                <p>I have created this website to showcase a portfolio of projects I've worked on over the years, including most recently a number of websites and web applications developed during a software bootcamp (where I acquired the skills I've used to create this very website!), and additionally a gallery of art pieces I've worked on at various points over the last decade. I hope this portfolio provides you with an overview of my capabilities and especially my drive to create with determination and passion.</p>

The main use cases would be: a feed section for viewing, submitting, and commenting on posts; a reviews section to read and submit reviews on a number of puzzles; and a leaderboards section to see solve-time rankings and even add your own.

                        <p>I've been passionate about creating artworks for as long as I can remember - during my school years, you would always find me with a sketchbook and set of pencils, drawing anything and everything I could. Just before starting at university I discovered the medium of digital art, and now thoroughly enjoy the additional benefits of using tech to bring my ideas to life. You can view various pieces from my artistic journey below.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">I've always been a creative individual: whether it was drawing pictures, making sculptures out of clay, or building structures with LEGO and K'Nex, making things has been a strong passion at my core since day 1. During my secondary school and university years in particular, I really got into the swing of things once I got my hands on a Samsung tablet with a stylus and discovered the world of digital art, which brought so many more possibilities.</p><br>
                            <p class="card-text">As I've gotten older and moved into the world of work, it's not been as easy to exercise those creative muscles - priorities change and time becomes less and less available. However, I've tried my best to keep up with the passion and even tried to incorporate my artistic skillset into my jobs when possible and appropriate.</p><br>
                            <p class="card-text">At this point in time, I'm making a career change from my previous roles in data analysis, project management, and software implementation, into a more technical software development role. This direction is much more aligned with my core values and strengths as I'm a logical and hands-on person, and more importantly it allows me to express my creativity and desire to build. Creating websites and web applications during the 16-week intensive bootcamp with Code Institute that I've recently completed has been a joy and an experience that resonates with my true purpose: to make things. I'm looking forward to the future in which I hope to build many more things that I can be proud of.</p><br>
